An automaton (/ɔːˈtɒmətən/; plural: automata or automatons) is a relatively self-operating machine, or control mechanism designed to automatically follow a sequence of operations, or respond to predetermined instructions.

A cellular automaton (CA) is a collection of cells arranged in a grid of specified shape, such that each cell changes state as a function of time, according to a defined set of rules driven by the states of neighboring cells. 

A CA is a collection of colored cells or atoms on a grid of a specified shape. Each cell is in one of a finite number of states. This [computational model](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/computational-modeling) is both abstract and spatially and temporally discrete.

_Computational_ means the model can compute functions and solve [algorithmic](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/algorithm) problems. _Abstract_ refers to the fact that a CA can be specified in purely mathematical terms. A CA is discrete in both space and time, which means that in each time unit, the cells that constitute the CA represent one of a finite set of states. Additionally, the cells in a grid evolve in parallel at discrete time steps by considering the states of neighboring cells.

As a result, the evolution of the CA through several discrete time steps occurs based on a set of rules founded on the states of neighboring cells. These rules can be iteratively applied for as many time steps as required.

Typical characteristics of a CA are the following:

-   The cells in a CA reside on a grid which has a specified shape (square, triangle, hexagon, etc.) and exist in a finite number of dimensions.
-   Each cell on the grid has a state. While there are numerous finite possibilities of the state, the simplest state form is usually ON or OFF (or TRUE/FALSE or 1/0).
-   The cells adjacent to one cell constitute its neighborhood. Cells in a neighborhood affect each other, and each cell on the CA grid has a neighborhood.
