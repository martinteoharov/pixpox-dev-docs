# Entity Component System

Entity Component System (ECS) is a design pattern responsible for representing the world and its various objects (player, light, physics, etc..). An ECS comprises of entities, which are composed of components and lastly systems which operate on said entities.

This design pattern allows us to build logic that is incredibly flexible while also being immensely performative. it is the best choice for a complicated game engine full of various interconnected behaviour.

### How it is built

- ##### Unique Identifiers
	
	Every entity and every component has a unique identifier associated with it. 
	Unique sequential IDs are managed using a Queue data-structure.

- ##### Signatures
	asd


- ##### Entities
- ##### Components
- ##### Systems




### Rust TypeSystem integration
