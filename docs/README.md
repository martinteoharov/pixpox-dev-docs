## PixPox Engine

PixPox is a 2D Game Engine built around the concept of simulating most pixels on screen using simple [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton) rules! 

This obsidian vault is to be a research database. It will document the design patterns, data structures, algorithms and various optimizations used throughout the project.
