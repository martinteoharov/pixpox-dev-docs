The PixPox renderer will be written from scratch and will, in practice, act as a wrapper for WGPU (which is another low-level rendering library that is an abstraction one level above OpenGL, Vulkan and other backends).

Since I do not have any experience with writing a renderer, I'll be using the project wgpu-rust-renderer as my north star and will be following its general style and file system, 

I will be documenting the process as I go along.



## The vision

The perfect renderer for pixpox will have the following features.
